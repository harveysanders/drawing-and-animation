###The Display List

The CreateJS framework uses a nestable display-list, similar to the Flash ecosystem.  The display list is like a tree, allowing us to add display objects onto a stage (think of the stage like the stage of a theater), and once added to the stage, those display objects become visible.  Removed from the stage, the display objects are no longer rendered, and are not visible to the user.

The stage is the top most parent display object in the display hierarchy.  And display objects are nestable, meaning, we can group other display objects inside a (parent) display object, such that when we move the parent object, the children display objects move with it.

There are several types of display objects, each specialized for a particular purpose, like the Shape Class, which is generally used for drawing simple graphics.  We'll work with many of them in our Motion Poem series.

###Adding and Positioning Display Objects on the Stage

CreateJS draws its visual elements, display objects, onto the HTML5 Canvas element, which is wrapped by the Stage object.

Display objects are positioned using a cartesian coordinate system on x and y axis, which x axis values incrementing to the right, and the y axis values incrementing downward.  The top left corner of the stage is at 0, 0, meaning the value of x is 0 and the value of y is 0.  So, if you place a display object at the top left corner of the stage, its x and y position values will both equal 0.

We're going to work with the Graphics API of the Shape Class, however, in our exercise, we've wrapped the API in a utility module, called `draw` to abstract away some of the boilerplate.

For more information on the CreateJS Graphics API, see:

http://www.createjs.com/Docs/EaselJS/classes/Graphics.html

##Lesson Steps

###Creating and Adding Shapes to the Display List

Let's create and position some shapes onto the stage:  Open up the file at:

    `js/view.js`

####TODO 1 : Create a Rectangle Background

Find the `p.initialize()` function, and using our `draw` utility, add a rectangle to our view using the `addChild` API:

````javascript
p.initialize = function () {
    // TODO 1 : Add a background //
    view.addChild(draw.rect(canvas.width, canvas.height, "#4c4c4c", "#000"));
````

The simplified `draw.rect()` API takes values for `width`, `height` `color` and `strokeColor`, the color of the border.  We pass the result of the `draw.rect()` to the `view.addChild()` method, which adds the Shape to the display list.

Great, **save the file** (Mac: Command-S, Windows: Ctrl-S), then run the app by:

A) **Selecting the index.html tab**, then **clicking the "Play" button**:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OperationSpark/using-c9/master/img/running-index.html.png">

Upon doing so, wait a second, and in your Console View at the bottom of the IDE, you'll see:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OperationSpark/using-c9/master/img/apache-serving-web-page.png">

B) Now copy (Mac: Command-C, Windows: Ctrl-C) the URL after the log mesage: `Staring Apache httpd, serving`.  The URL should be:

    https://drawing-and-animation-myuser.c9.io/index.html.
    
Make sure you don't copy the trailing _period_, if you do, don't worry, just delete it in the next step, when you paste the URL.  See the red-highlighted box, below:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OperationSpark/using-c9/master/img/copy-server-url.png">

C) Once copied, open up a new tab in Chrome, and paste that URL into the address bar:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OperationSpark/using-c9/master/img/pasting-url.png">

D) Finally, after pasting the URL in the address bar, press `enter`:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OperationSpark/drawing-and-animation/master/img/background.png">

Alright, pat yourself on the back, you successfully created a rectangle and placed it on our display list!

Awesome, **keep this tab open** - we'll switch back and forth, code in IDE tab, refresh in the app tab to see our changes.

####TODO 2 : Create a Circle

````javascript
    // TODO 2 : Create a circle and add it to our view //
    var circle = draw.circle(20, '#CCC');
    view.addChild(circle);
````

Here we use the simplified drawCircle API of the draw utility, which takes the radius of the circle and its color.

Great stuff, save and switch back to our other tab where the app is running and refresh your browser (Mac: Command-R, Windows: Ctrl-R).  

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OperationSpark/drawing-and-animation/master/img/quarter-cirle.png">

Neat, but wait, our circle is only one quarter visable, why?

Well, the radius of a circle is the length of a line segment from its center to its perimeter, and when we created our circle, we gave it a radius of `20`, but by default the _registration point_, that is, the location of 0, 0 within its own coordinate space, is centered in the circle.

Remember, each display object _also_ has its internal coordinate system - so if we placed some other display object inside our circle at 0, 0, that display object would be positioned at the center of the circle.

Likewise, when we place the circle on the view (its parent display object) at 0, 0, that equates to the top left corner of the view, and means the center of the cirle will be placed at 0, 0 in the view's coordinate system.  Thus, our circle is only a quarter visible.

Let's move it fully onto the stage by changing the x and y value of the circle, in fact, let's center it in the view:

####TODO 3 : Centering Display Objects

````javascript
    // TODO 3 : Position our circle in the center of the canvas //
    circle.x = canvas.width / 2;
    circle.y = canvas.height / 2;
````

Here, we're setting the x and y properties of our circle to be at half the canvas width and height, and because the x/y registration point of the circle is centered in itself, we're good to go.

If our display object was a rectangle or square, to center it on the canvas, we'd have to do:

````javascript
rectangle.x = (canvas.width - rectangle.width) / 2;
rectangle.y = (canvas.height - rectangle.height) / 2;
````

Notice above, we offset for the half the width and height of the rectangle too.  Why?

Awesome, save, switch tabs, and refresh:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OperationSpark/drawing-and-animation/master/img/centered-circle.png">

Fantastic, we're cooking with gas, our circle is dead center.  Now let's add a few more shapes:

####TODO 4 : A Few More Rectangles

````javascript
    // TODO 4 : 
    var rectangleOne = draw.rect(20, 100, "#00F", "#000");
    view.addChild(rectangleOne);

    var rectangleTwo = draw.rect(20, 100, "#00F", "#000");
    rectangleTwo.x = canvas.width - rectangleTwo.width;
    rectangleTwo.y = canvas.height - rectangleTwo.height;
    view.addChild(rectangleTwo);
}
````

You know what do to, save, switch, refresh:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OperationSpark/drawing-and-animation/master/img/game-scene.png">

Who-oh, this is starting to look vaguely 70's!  Could it be?  That's right!  Our quick lesson on drawing shapes is about to turn into a classic game tutorial!

####TODO 5 : Adding Velocity

Alrighty, let's set up a few more properties before we exit the `p.initialize()` method:

````javascript
// TODO 5 : Add some velocity properties to our display objects // 
circle.velocityX = 5;
circle.velocityY = -5;
rectangleTwo.velocityY = 6;
````

These velocity properties represent the rate at which our circle and rectangleTwo will move.

####TODO 6 : Exposing our View Objects

Next, let's add a reference to our shapes on our view object such that we can access them from other methods within this module, namely, our `p.update()` method.  If we didn't do this, the variables we created wouldn't be so readily accessible (we'd be able to retrieve them as children of the `view`, but we couldn't do some by name):

````javascript
// TODO 6 : Add a reference to our shapes on the view object //
view.circle = circle;
view.rectangleOne = rectangleOne;
view.rectangleTwo= rectangleTwo
````

Superb!  Let's move onto our `p.update()` method.  The update method is called 60 times per second by our the CreateJS framework.  In this method, we'll implement our game logic, and you'll see that we're able to animate and even check if our shape objects collide with each other:

####TODO 7 : Creating Local Variables

Sometimes, especially if you will access this variables often, it pays to create a local reference to the variables so we don't have to continually reach into the parent objects to access them - this is a form of optimization:

````javascript
// TODO 7 : Create some local variables that we will use often //
var circle          = view.circle;
var rectangleOne    = view.rectangleOne;
var rectangleTwo    = view.rectangleTwo;
````

####TODO 8 : Making the Circle Move

Let's update the position of our circle each frame based on its velocityX and velocityY values:

````javascript
// TODO 8 : Update the position of the circle based on its x-axis and y-axis velocity //
circle.x            += circle.velocityX;
circle.y            += circle.velocityY;
````

Ok, try it out, save, switch tabs, refresh:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OperationSpark/drawing-and-animation/master/img/ball-out.png">

Whoa, the circle made a beeline off the stage!  And didn't come back!

Alrighty, let's box our circle in, hahaha, ahh:

####TODO 9 : Coding Constraints

````javascript
// TODO 9 : Code the circle's top and bottom boundary check //
if((circle.y - circle.radius) < 0) { 
    circle.velocityY = -circle.velocityY;
}
if((circle.y + circle.radius) > canvas.height) { 
    circle.velocityY = -circle.velocityY; 
}
````

Sweet, save, switch, refresh!  Nice, our circle bounces off the ceiling, respecting our boundary constraints!  But now we gotta get our player's into the game:

####TODO 10 : Player Movement

Ok, next, let's write some logic to power or player's movement:

````javascript
// TODO 10 : Code the player's movement //
rectangleOne.y = stage.mouseY - rectangleOne.height / 2;

// Player's boundary check //
if (rectangleOne.y + rectangleOne.height > canvas.height) {
    rectangleOne.y = canvas.height - rectangleOne.height;
} else if (rectangleOne.y < 0) {
    rectangleOne.y = 0;
}
````

We also did a check to make sure the player stays within the bounds of our game scene, that is, our canvas.  Notice we subtracted half the height of rectangleOne from its y position, relative to the mouse - this is so the mouse will remain centered with the rectangle for a better user experience.

Go ahead, save, switch, refresh, you'll notice now that your mouse controls the left rectangle, our player:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OperationSpark/drawing-and-animation/master/img/player-movement.png">

####TODO 11 : AI Movement

Yah!  Now for the AI's movement:

````javascript
// TODO 11 : Write AI's movement //
if((rectangleTwo.y + rectangleTwo.height / 2) < (circle.y - 14)) {
    rectangleTwo.y = rectangleTwo.y + rectangleTwo.velocityY;
}
else if((rectangleTwo.y + rectangleTwo.height / 2) > (circle.y+14)) {
    rectangleTwo.y = rectangleTwo.y - rectangleTwo.velocityY;
}
````

You know what to do: Our AI now follows the circle, except, without any collision detection, our game is over pretty fast, so let's get that in place next:

####TODO 12 : Player Collision Check

````javascript
// TODO 12: Implement the player's collision check //
if(circle.x - circle.radius <= rectangleOne.width 
    && circle.x - circle.radius > 0 
    && circle.y >= rectangleOne.y 
    && circle.y < rectangleOne.y + rectangleOne.height)    
{       
    circle.velocityX *= -1;
}
````

And while we're here:

####TODO 13 : AI Collision Check

````javascript
// TODO 13 : Create the AI collision check //
if(circle.x + circle.radius > rectangleTwo.x 
    && circle.x + circle.radius < rectangleTwo.x + rectangleTwo.width 
    && circle.y >= rectangleTwo.y 
    && circle.y < rectangleTwo.y + rectangleTwo.height)
{
    circle.velocityX *= -1;
}
````

All Aces!  Save, switch tabs, and refresh:  We have ourselves a game!

**Now:** What can we improve about our classic Pong game?
